      <h2>What is the CHPL?</h2>
      <p>The Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) is a comprehensive and authoritative listing of all certified health information technology that have been successfully tested and certified by the ONC Health IT Certification program. All products listed on the CHPL have been tested by an ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratory (ONC-ATL) and certified by an ONC-Authorized Certification Body (ONC-ACB) to meet criteria adopted by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
      <p>For additional information on how to navigate the CHPL, please refer to the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/policy/chpl_public_user_guide.pdf" analytics-on="click" analytics-event="CHPL Public User Guide" analytics-properties="{ category: 'Resources', label: '' }">CHPL Public User Guide</a></p>
      <p>For more information on attesting for Promoting Interoperability under the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), please see the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms/registrationandattestation.html">CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs Registration &amp; Attestation Page</a>.</p>

      </span>
      <h2>Using the CHPL Website</h2>
      <h3>How do I use the CHPL to view certified health information technology?</h3>
      <p>To search for certified health information technology, type a developer name, product name, CHPL Product ID, or ONC-ACB Certification ID into the main search area. Alternatively, you may choose to browse all certified products by clicking the 'Browse all' option. Filters are also available to search for product listings matching specific criteria (e.g., certification criteria, clinical quality measurements, etc.). The CHPL will display your search results based on the information entered.</p>
      <h3>How do I create a CMS EHR Certification ID?</h3>
      <p>To create a CMS EHR Certification ID, search for the products that you would like to use your CMS Certification ID. Once you have located the product listings you would like to use, click the yellow "+CertID" button to the right of the product listing on the search results page to add to the 'CMS ID Creator' widget at the top of the page. Once you have entered all of the desired product listings, you will be able to generate a CMS EHR Certification ID by clicking the 'Get EHR Certification ID' button, if the combination of product listings selected meets the program requirements.</p>
      <h3>What is the difference between an ONC-ACB Certification ID and CHPL Product Number (CHPL ID)?</h3>
      <p>CHPL IDs are unique to each certified product. There are two types of CHPL IDs depending on the certified product. Certified products from the CHPL 4.0 (those certified before March 28, 2016) have CHPL IDs in the following format: <code>CHP-XXXXXX</code> (e.g., <code>CHP-022989</code>). Products certified for the first time on the new "open data" CHPL (those certified after March 28, 2016) have CHPL IDs in the following format: <code>Edition.ATL.ACB.Developer.Product.Version.ICS.ReliedUponSoftware.Date</code> (e.g., <code>15.04.04.1064.Alls.AM.0.1.160804</code>).</p>
      <p>ONC-ACB Certification IDs are generated by each ONC-ACB and may not have a consistent format. In addition, a single ONC-ACB Certification ID may reference more than one certified product.</p>
      <h3>How do I compare products?</h3>
      <p>To compare product listings, please navigate to the product listings you would like to compare and use the green '+Compare' button to the right of the product listing information on the search results page or in the upper right-hand corner of the product listing detail page to add the product listings to the 'Compare' module. Once you have identified all the product listings you would like to compare, click the blue 'Compare Products' button in the module (pops out once at least one product listing is selected) to view the products side-by-side.</p>
      <h3>How would I report a problem or concern with my certified health information technology?</h3>
      <p>Errors or questions regarding product listings should be directed based on the table below. A list of ONC-ACB contact information can be found on ONC's <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/certification-process">Certification Bodies</a> and <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/testing-process-test-methods">Testing Laboratories</a> pages.</p>

      </span>
      <h2>ONC Certification Program</h2>
      <h3>How does the certification process work?</h3>
      <p>The ONC Certification Program was established to ensure that certified health information technology adheres to the security, functionality, and technology requirements adopted by HHS. ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC-ACBs) certify health IT products that were successfully tested by an ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratory (ONC-ATL) against the certification criteria adopted by HHS. Products listed on the CHPL have been successfully certified through the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/about-onc-health-it-certification-program">ONC Health IT Certification Program</a> by an ONC-ACB.</p>
      <p>Certification criteria establish the required capabilities, standards, and implementation specifications that health information technology needs to meet in order to become certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program. Certified health IT products can be used for participation in CMS quality reporting programs and State Promoting Interoperability Programs.</p>
      <h3>Which Certification Edition do I need to use to attest for Promoting Interoperability Programs?</h3>
      <p>For more information on attesting to Promoting Interoperability, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms/registrationandattestation.html">CMS Promoting Interoperability Programs Registration and Attestation Page</a>.</p>
      <h3>What are clinical quality measures (CQMs)?</h3>
      <p>Clinical quality measures (CQMs) are used to measure and track the quality of healthcare services delivered by eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals.</p>
      <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/legislation/ehrincentiveprograms/clinicalqualitymeasures.html">CMS Clinical Quality Measures Basics page</a>.</p>
      <h3>What are electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs)?</h3>
      <p>eCQMs use data from electronic health records (EHR) and/or health information technology systems to measure health care quality. CMS, along with other HHS agencies, use eCQMs in a variety of quality reporting and incentive programs. For more information on eCQMs, please visit the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/">eCQI Resource Center</a>.</p>

      <h2>For EHR Developers</h2>
      <h3>How can a product be added to the CHPL?</h3>
      <p>To be listed on the CHPL, health information technology must first be successfully tested by an ONC-ATL and then certified by an ONC-ACB against at least one <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/standards-and-certification-regulations">certification criterion adopted by HHS</a>. For more information on the ONC Certification Program, ONC-ATLs, and ONC-ACBs, please see the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/about-onc-health-it-certification-program">ONC Health IT Certification Program page</a>.</p>
