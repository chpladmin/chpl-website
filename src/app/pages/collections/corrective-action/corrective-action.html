      This is a list of all health IT products for which a non-conformity has been recorded. A certified product is non-conforming if, at any time, an ONC-Authorized Certification Body (ONC-ACB) or ONC determines that the product does not comply with a requirement of certification. Non-conformities reported as part of surveillance are noted as "Surveillance NCs", while non-conformities identified though an ONC Direct Review are noted as "Direct Review NCs". Not all non-conformities affect a product's functionality, and the existence of a non-conformity does not by itself mean that a product is "defective." Developers of certified products are required to notify customers of non-conformities and must take approved corrective actions to address such non-conformities in a timely and effective manner. Detailed information about non-conformities, and associated corrective action plans, can be accessed below by clicking on the product's CHPL ID.
