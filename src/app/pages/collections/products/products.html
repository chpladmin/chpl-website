      This list includes all health IT products that have had their status changed to a "decertified" status on the Certified Health IT Products List (CHPL). A product may be decertified for the following reasons: certificate terminated by ONC, certificate withdrawn by an ONC-ACB, or certification withdrawn by an ONC-ACB because the health IT developer requested it to be withdrawn when the product was under ONC-ACB surveillance or ONC direct review. For further descriptions of the certification statuses, please consult the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/policy/chpl_public_user_guide.pdf" analytics-on="click" analytics-event="CHPL Public User Guide" analytics-properties="{ category: 'Resources', label: '' }">CHPL Public User Guide</a>. For more information on how a decertified product may affect your attestation to the CMS EHR Incentive Programs, please consult the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/FAQ.html">CMS FAQ</a>. For additional information about how a decertified product may affect your participation in other CMS programs, please reach out to that program.
